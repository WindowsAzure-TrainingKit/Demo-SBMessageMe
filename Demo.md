# Service Bus Message Me #

---

<a name="Overview" />
## Overview ##

The Windows Azure Service Bus provides a hosted, secure, and widely available infrastructure for widespread communication, large-scale event distribution, naming, and service publishing.

This demo is designed to show how the Windows Azure Service Bus messaging can be used by applications to exchange messages in a loosely coupled way for improved scale and resiliency. This is a fun example that consists of a simple ASP.NET MVC Mobile Web Application that sends messages to a Service Bus queue and a console application that reads from the queue and displays the messages.

	>
	> You'll notice how fast it is now inside Windows Azure. We have just stood up a new website in one of Azure data centers. We can see the website's Dashboard page, which doesn't show any monitoring data yet, because I don't actually have my website deployed.
	>
	> Let's deploy the application to the website I've just created. For this purpose, we could choose between different approaches like using standard FTP tools and just copy the bits up; use our Team Foundation Server to link the project to the web site and any time someone checks in source-code into that project automatically do a build, run your unit tests and, if they succeed, deploy the project into Windows Azure; or, what will be our choice, directly use Visual Studio IDE for the deployment.

1. Save the **Publish Profile** file to your computer.

	![Downloading Publish Settings](Images/downloading-publish-settings.png?raw=true "Downloading Publish Settings")

	_Downloading Publish Settings_

	>**Speaking Point:** 
	>
	> From the management portal, I'll download a publishing profile from the Dashboard page.
	> This is just an XML file that has all of my publish settings which I will use to set up Visual Studio so we can just directly deploy within the IDE.

1. Go back to the Visual Studio instance, and stop the application (if it is still running). Right click the project and click **Publish**.
